- 👋 Hi, I’m Vince Nkawu, a full stack engineer with strong security background.
- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack projects or security engineering projects. I worked in data security and the SOC for 7 years. Recently I've been building tools in the cloud primary AWS and GCP. Tools that our Incedent Response consultants at Palo Alto use. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning django framework, also learning to hack and find security flaws in applications and systems. I enjoyed understanding the intricacies of how a system or application is functioning. Prior to getting into security, I enjoyed building web applications using java mvc framework, jsp, html, css, bootstrap
- 💞️ As an artist, frontend work and design does tic my happy box. I enjoy when i'm part of both back and front end design of a project.
- I’m looking to collaborate on security projects, contribute to security communities, bug bounty, blockchain projects, optimizing or building new security tools. There is so much to learn and i always feel like I dont know enough.
