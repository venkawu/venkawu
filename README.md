- 👋 Hi, I’m Vince Nkawu
- 👀 I’m interested in security engineering projects. I have worked in security (infrastructure security) for 7 years. Architecting, deploying and operating 3rd party security tools for encryption, pki, authentication, information rights management, data lost prevention, cloud security and SIEM
- I've built applications in java and python. Also automated business processes with pythons scripts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning django framework, also learning to hack and find security flaws in applications and systems. I enjoyed understanding the intricacies of how a system or application is functioning. Prior to getting into security, I enjoyed building web applications and front end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on security projects, contribute to security communities, bug bounty, blockchain projects, optimizing or building new security tools. There is so much to learn and i always feel like i dont know enough.
